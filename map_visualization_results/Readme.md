# Introduction

The directory contains files with maps displaying real estate characteristics based on the dataset.

Current data is shown on the maps:  
- **interactive_municipalitets_map_v3.html** – breakdown by municipalities  
- **interactive_provinces_map_v3.html** – breakdown by provinces  

To view them online, you can follow the links:

GitHub does not render HTML files directly, so you can download them locally as HTML files and open them on your computer.

The interactive maps **interactive_map_with_variance.html** and **interactive_municipalitets_map.html** are too large to display on GitHub. To view them, you need to clone the repository and open them locally.

Files with the `.png` extension are static maps, representing intermediate visualization results.
